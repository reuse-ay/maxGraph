/**
 * @class
 *
 * Singleton that implements a clipboard for graph cells.
 *
 * To copy the selection cells from the graph to the clipboard and paste them into graph2, do the following:
 * ```javascript
 * Clipboard.copy(graph);
 * Clipboard.paste(graph2);
 * ```
 *
 * For fine-grained control of the clipboard data the {@link Graph.canExportCell} and {@link Graph.canImportCell} functions can be overridden.
 *
 * To restore previous parents for pasted cells, the implementation for {@link copy} and {@link paste} can be changed as follows.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * Clipboard.copy = function(graph: Graph, cells: Cell[]): void {
 *   cells = cells ?? graph.getSelectionCells();
 *   const result = graph.getExportableCells(cells);
 *
 *   Clipboard.parents = new Object();
 *   for (let i = 0; i < result.length; i++) {
 *     Clipboard.parents[i] = graph.model.getParent(cells[i]);
 *   }
 *
 *   Clipboard.insertCount = 1;
 *   Clipboard.setCells(graph.cloneCells(result));
 *
 *   return result;
 * };
 *
 * Clipboard.paste = function(graph: Graph): void {
 *   if (Clipboard.isEmpty()) {
 *     return;
 *   }
 *   const cells = graph.getImportableCells(Clipboard.getCells());
 *   const delta = Clipboard.insertCount * Clipboard.STEPSIZE;
 *   const parent = graph.getDefaultParent();
 *
 *   graph.model.beginUpdate();
 *   try {
 *     for (let i = 0; i < cells.length; i++) {
 *       const tmp = (Clipboard.parents && graph.model.contains(Clipboard.parents[i])) ?
 *            Clipboard.parents[i] : parent;
 *       cells[i] = graph.importCells([cells[i]], delta, delta, tmp)[0];
 *     }
 *   }
 *   finally {
 *     graph.model.endUpdate();
 *   }
 *
 *   // Increments the counter and selects the inserted cells
 *   Clipboard.insertCount++;
 *   graph.setSelectionCells(cells);
 * };
 * ```
