## PR Checklist

- [ ] Addresses an existing open issue: closes #<the_issue_number_here>. If not, explain why (minor changes, etc.).
- [ ] You have discussed this issue with the maintainers of `maxGraph`, and you are assigned to the issue.
- [ ] The scope of the PR is sufficiently narrow to be examined in a single session. A PR covering several issues must be split into separate PRs. Do not create a large PR, otherwise it cannot be reviewed and you will be asked to split it later or the PR will be closed.
- [ ] I have added tests to prove my fix is effective or my feature works. This can be done in the form of automatic tests in `packages/core/_tests_` or a new or altered Storybook story in `packages/html/stories` (an existing story may also demonstrate the change).
- [ ] I have provided screenshot/videos to demonstrate the change. If no releavant, explain why.
- [ ] I have added or edited necessary documentation, or no docs changes are needed.
- [ ] The PR title follows the ["Conventional Commits"](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines.

*type* can be (see existing Pull Request for more elements):

  ...

If defined, the _optional scope_ must be put in parentheses.

Note: The title is used as proposal for the maintainer merging the Pull Request.
